# zstack_images (Data Source)

Fetches a list of images and their associated attributes from the ZStack environment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
#  Copyright (c) ZStack.io, Inc.

data "zstack_images" "example" {
  #  name = "imageName"
  #   name_pattern = "hostname%"  # Pattern for fuzzy name search, similar to MySQL LIKE. Use % for multiple characters and _ for exactly one character.
  filter {
    name   = "architecture"
    values = ["aarch64", "x86_64"]
  }
  filter {
    name   = "state"
    values = ["Enabled"]
  }
  filter {
    name   = "status"
    values = ["Ready", "Deleted"]
  }
  filter {
    name   = "guest_os_type"
    values = ["Linux"]
  }
}

output "zstack_images" {
  value = data.zstack_images.example
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `filter` (Block List) Filter resources based on any field in the schema. For example, to filter by status, use `name = "status"` and `values = ["Ready"]`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--filter))
- `name` (String) Exact name for searching images
- `name_pattern` (String) Pattern for fuzzy name search, similar to MySQL LIKE. Use % for multiple characters and _ for exactly one character.

### Read-Only

- `images` (Attributes List) List of Images (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--images))

<a id="nestedblock--filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filter`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the field to filter by (e.g., status, state).
- `values` (Set of String) Values to filter by. Multiple values will be treated as an OR condition.


<a id="nestedatt--images"></a>
### Nested Schema for `images`

Read-Only:

- `architecture` (String) CPU architecture of the image, such as x86_64, aarch64, mips64, or longarch64
- `format` (String) Format of the image, such as qcow2, iso, vmdk, or raw
- `guest_os_type` (String) Operating system type of the image (e.g., Linux, Windows)
- `name` (String) Name of the image
- `platform` (String) Platform of the image, such as Linux, Windows, or Other
- `state` (String) State of the image, indicating if it is Enabled or Disabled
