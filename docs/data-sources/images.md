# zstack_images (Data Source)

Fetches a list of images and their associated attributes from the ZStack environment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Copyright (c) ZStack.io, Inc.

data "zstack_hosts" "example" {
  #  name = "hostname"
  #   name_pattern = "hostname%"  # Pattern for fuzzy name search, similar to MySQL LIKE. Use % for multiple characters and _ for exactly one character.
  filter = { # option
    State            = "Enabled"
    Status           = "Connected"
    HypervisorType   = "KVM"
    Architecture     = "x86_64"
    TotalCpuCapacity = "480"
    ManagementIp     = "172.30.3.4"
  }
}

output "zstack_hosts" {
  value = data.zstack_hosts.example
}
```
