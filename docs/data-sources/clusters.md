# zstack_clusters (Data Source)

Fetches a list of clusters and their associated attributes.

## Example Usage

```terraform
#  Copyright (c) ZStack.io, Inc.

data "zstack_clusters" "example" {
  #name = "cluster1"
  #name_pattern = "clu%"  # Pattern for fuzzy name search, similar to MySQL LIKE. Use % for multiple characters and _ for exactly one character.
  filter {
    name   = "architecture"
    values = ["aarch64", "x86_64"]
  }
  filter {
    name   = "state"
    values = ["Enabled"]
  }
  filter {
    name   = "hypervisor_type"
    values = ["KVM"]
  }
}

output "zstack_clusters" {
  value = data.zstack_clusters.example
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `filter` (Block List) Filter resources based on any field in the schema. For example, to filter by status, use `name = "status"` and `values = ["Ready"]`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--filter))
- `name` (String) Exact name for searching Cluster
- `name_pattern` (String) Pattern for fuzzy name search, similar to MySQL LIKE. Use % for multiple characters and _ for exactly one character.

### Read-Only

- `clusters` (Attributes List) List of clusters matching the specified filters (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--clusters))

<a id="nestedblock--filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filter`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the field to filter by (e.g., status, state).
- `values` (Set of String) Values to filter by. Multiple values will be treated as an OR condition.


<a id="nestedatt--clusters"></a>
### Nested Schema for `clusters`

Read-Only:

- `architecture` (String) Architecture of the cluster
- `hypervisor_type` (String) Type of hypervisor used by the cluster (e.g., KVM, ESXi)
- `name` (String) Name of the cluster
- `state` (String) State of the cluster (e.g., Enabled, Disabled)
- `type` (String) ype of the cluster
- `uuid` (String) UUID identifier of the cluster
- `zone_uuid` (String) UUID of the zone to which the cluster belongs
