# zstack_clusters (Data Source)

Fetches a list of clusters and their associated attributes.

## Example Usage

```terraform
#  Copyright (c) ZStack.io, Inc.

data "zstack_clusters" "example" {
  #name = "cluster1"
  #name_pattern = "clu%"  # Pattern for fuzzy name search, similar to MySQL LIKE. Use % for multiple characters and _ for exactly one character.
  filter = { # option
    State          = "Enabled"
    HypervisorType = "KVM"
    Architecture   = "x86_64"
  }
}

output "zstack_clusters" {
  value = data.zstack_clusters.example
}
```
