# zstack_backupstorages (Data Source)

List all backup storages, or query backup storages by exact name match, or query backup storages by name pattern fuzzy match.

## Example Usage

```terraform
#  Copyright (c) ZStack.io, Inc.

data "zstack_backupstorages" "example" {
  #   name  = "backupstorage name"
  #   name_pattern = "image%"  # Pattern for fuzzy name search, similar to MySQL LIKE. Use % for multiple characters and _ for exactly one character.
  filter = { # option
    Status = "Connected"
    State  = "Enabled"
  }
}

output "zstack_imagestorages" {
  value = data.zstack_backupstorage.example
