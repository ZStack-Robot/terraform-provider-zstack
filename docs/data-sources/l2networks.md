# zstack_l2networks (Data Source)

Fetches a list of L2 networks and their associated attributes from the ZStack environment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Copyright (c) ZStack.io, Inc.

data "zstack_l2networks" "networks" {
  #   name = "L2 networks name"
  #   name_pattern = "L2 networks name% Pattern"   # Pattern for fuzzy name search, similar to MySQL LIKE. Use % for multiple characters and _ for exactly one character.
  filter = {
    Vlan = 36
    Type = "L2VlanNetwork"
  }
}

output "zstack_l2networks" {
  value = data.zstack_l2networks.networks
}
```
