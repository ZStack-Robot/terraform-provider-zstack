# zstack_l2networks (Data Source)

Fetches a list of L2 networks and their associated attributes from the ZStack environment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Copyright (c) ZStack.io, Inc.

data "zstack_l2networks" "networks" {
  #   name = "L2 networks name"
  #   name_pattern = "L2 networks name% Pattern"   # Pattern for fuzzy name search, similar to MySQL LIKE. Use % for multiple characters and _ for exactly one character.
  filter {
    name   = "vlan"
    values = [36]
  }
  filter {
    name   = "physical_interface"
    values = ["ens29f1"]
  }
}

output "zstack_l2networks" {
  value = data.zstack_l2networks.networks
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `filter` (Block List) Filter resources based on any field in the schema. For example, to filter by status, use `name = "status"` and `values = ["Ready"]`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--filter))
- `name` (String) Exact name for searching L2 Network.
- `name_pattern` (String) Pattern for fuzzy name search, similar to MySQL LIKE. Use % for multiple characters and _ for exactly one character.

### Read-Only

- `l2networks` (Attributes List) List of L2 networks matching the specified filters. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--l2networks))

### Nested Schema for `filter`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the field to filter by (e.g., status, state).
- `values` (Set of String) Values to filter by. Multiple values will be treated as an OR condition.


<a id="nestedatt--l2networks"></a>
### Nested Schema for `l2networks`

Read-Only:

- `attached_cluster_uuids` (List of String) UUIDs of clusters attached to the L2 network.
- `name` (String) Name of the L2 network.
- `physical_interface` (String) Physical interface associated with the L2 network.
- `type` (String) Type of the L2 network.
- `uuid` (String) UUID of the L2 network.
- `vlan` (Number) VLAN ID of the L2 network.
- `zone_uuid` (String) UUID of the zone where the L2 network resides.
