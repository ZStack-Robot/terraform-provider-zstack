# ZStack Cloud Provider

The ZStack Cloud provider is used to interact with the many resources supported by [ZStack Cloud](http://www.zstack.io). The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

## Example Usage

```
# Copyright (c) ZStack.io, Inc.
# Configure the ZStack Cloud Provider by access_key

provider "zstack" {
  host              = "ip address of zstack cloud api endpoint"
  access_key_id     = "access_key_id of zstack cloud"
  access_key_secret = "access_key_secret of zstack cloud"
}

```

or 

```
# Copyright (c) ZStack.io, Inc.
# Configure the ZStack Cloud Provider by Account Name and password
provider "zstack" {
  host             = "ip address of zstack cloud api endpoint"
  account_name     = "admin"
  account_password = "password"
