# zstack_virtual_router_image (Resource)

This resource allows you to manage virtual router images in ZStack. A virtual router image is a template used to create virtual router instances, which are essential for network services such as routing, NAT, and VPN. You can define the image's properties, such as its name, description, URL, platform, and backup storage locations.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Copyright (c) ZStack.io, Inc.

data "zstack_backupstorages" "example" {
  name = "bs"
}

resource "zstack_virtual_router_image" "test" {
  name                 = "virtual router name"
  description          = "An example virtual router image"
  url                  = "http://zstack-image-server.zstack.io/zstack_iso/cloud/5.2.0/zstack-vrouter-240904-14.qcow2"
  architecture         = "x86_64"
  virtio               = true
  backup_storage_uuids = [data.zstack_backupstorages.example.backup_storages.0.uuid]
  boot_mode            = "legacy"
  guest_os_type        = "VyOS 1.1.7" #Attribute guest_os_type value must be one of: ["VyOS 1.1.7" "openEuler 22.03"]
}


output "zstack_vrimage" {
  value = zstack_virtual_router_image.test
}
```
