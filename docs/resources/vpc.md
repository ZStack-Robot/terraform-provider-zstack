# zstack_vpc (Resource)

This resource allows you to manage Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks in ZStack. A VPC network provides a logically isolated section of the cloud where you can launch resources such as virtual routers, subnets, and DNS services. You can define the VPC's properties, such as its name, description, associated L2 network, and subnet CIDR.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Copyright (c) ZStack.io, Inc.

resource "zstack_vpc" "test" {
  l2_network_uuid     = "l2_network_uuid data source"
  name                = "example"
  description         = "vpc network description"
  enable_ipam         = true
  dns                 = "dns ip address"
  virtual_router_uuid = "Attach virtual router  for this VPC network."
  subnet_cidr = {
    name         = "example-subnet"
    network_cidr = "192.168.110.0/24" # subnet cidr block
    gateway      = "192.168.110.1"    # gateway of subnet
  }
}

output "zstack_vpc" {
  value = zstack_vpc.test
}
```
